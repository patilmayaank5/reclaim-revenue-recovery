# Docs Generator

## Overview

Structured workflow for collaborative document creation. Act as an active guide through three stages: Context Gathering â†’ Refinement & Structure â†’ Reader Testing.

## When to Trigger

- User mentions: "write a doc", "draft a proposal", "create a spec", "write up"
- Doc types: PRD, design doc, decision doc, RFC, technical spec
- Substantial writing tasks requiring structure

## Workflow Stages

### ðŸŽ¯ Stage 1: Context Gathering

**Goal**: Close the knowledge gap between user and assistant.

1. **Initial Questions** (ask all 5):
   - What type of document?
   - Who's the primary audience?
   - What's the desired impact?
   - Is there a template?
   - Any constraints?

2. **Info Dumping**: Encourage user to dump all context
   - Background, discussions, alternatives, constraints
   - "Don't worry about organizing - just get it all out"

3. **Clarifying Questions**: Generate 5-10 numbered questions based on gaps

4. **Exit Condition**: When edge cases can be discussed without explaining basics

ðŸ“– **Detailed Guide**: Read `references/stage1-context.md`

### ðŸŽ¯ Stage 2: Refinement & Structure

**Goal**: Build document section by section.

**For each section**:
1. **Clarify**: Ask 5-10 questions about what to include
2. **Brainstorm**: Generate 5-20 numbered options
3. **Curate**: User indicates keep/remove/combine
4. **Gap Check**: Ask if anything important is missing
5. **Draft**: Use `str_replace` to write section
6. **Refine**: Iterate based on feedback

**Quality Checks**:
- After 3 iterations with no changes â†’ ask what can be removed
- At 80% completion â†’ check flow, consistency, redundancy

ðŸ“– **Detailed Guide**: Read `references/stage2-refine.md`

### ðŸŽ¯ Stage 3: Reader Testing

**Goal**: Verify document works for readers without context.

1. **Predict Questions**: Generate 5-10 reader questions
2. **Test**: Use sub-agent (no context bleed) to answer questions
3. **Check**: Look for ambiguity, false assumptions, contradictions
4. **Fix**: Loop back to Stage 2 for problematic sections

**Exit Condition**: Reader Claude consistently answers correctly

## Quick Reference

| Stage | Goal | Key Output |
|:------|:-----|:-----------|
| 1. Context | Close knowledge gap | 5-10 clarifying questions |
| 2. Refine | Section-by-section build | Drafted document |
| 3. Test | Verify for readers | Passed reader test |

## Tips

- **Tone**: Direct and procedural
- **User Agency**: Always allow skipping or adjusting process
- **Artifacts**: Use `create_file` for drafts, `str_replace` for edits
- **Integration**: If `docx` skill needed for Word output, reference it
